# Unit 01

## Install
1. Download the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install an editor. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) is popular amongst Python developers. Make sure you download the Community Edition which is **FREE**.

## Getting Comfortable

1. On your Desktop, search for Terminal (Mac) or Command Line (Windows), and open the application. You should see your username & your laptop:
```
lisanguyen@lisan-macbook-pro-us ~ %
```
2. Type in the following command to see available folders and files:

```
ls
```
You should see similar folders. Thought it might not be exact:
```
Applications	Documents	Library		Music		Public
Desktop		Downloads	Movies		Pictures	Sites
```
3. Let's navigate to the Desktop by **c**hanging **d**irectories.
```
cd Desktop
```

4. You can confirm that you're on your Desktop by listing the contents:
```
ls
```
5. Let's make a new folder for this class:
```
mkdir intro-to-python
```
6. Let's confirm the folder was created by listing the Desktop contents again.
```
ls
```
7. Next, let's create a new file:
```
touch unit-0.py
```
The command ```touch``` will look for an existing file before creating a new one.

8. Let's double check that the file was created!
```
ls
```

Congrats! You've nagivated your directory and created a new file.
