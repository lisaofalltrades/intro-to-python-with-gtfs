## <a id="comments"></a>Comments

```python
# this is a comment
```

Comments are one of the most useful tools in programming. Comments can be used to:

- organize code
- leave explanations for other developers
- exclude specific lines to code when running the script

See the example below:

```python

# variables
name = "Matt"
agency = "Turlock"

# After authentication, render user's name and ageny:

print(f"Welcome {name} from {agency}!")
# print("You have {num} blocks to review")
```

## <a id="print"></a>The `print()` function

```python
print("Hello! Welcome to my really cool app!")
```

`print()` is a built-in function in Python. Functions can be used to perform a variety of tasks. The parentheses are **required** in order for the function to work properly.

Data can be passed into the `print()` function's parentheses and that data will be displayed in the terminal. If no data is privided to `print()`, it displays a blank line.

```python
print('Hello world!') # Hello world!
print() # prints a blank line
print(4 + 4) # 8
```

## <a id="strings"></a>Datatype: Strings

There are many different datatypes in Python. The first one we will explore are Strings. String literals represent textual data.

```python
# Single quotes:
'allows embedded "double" quotes'

# Double quotes:
"allows embedded 'single' quotes".

#Triple quoted:
'''Three single quotes''', """Three double quotes"""
```

Triple quoted strings may **span multiple lines**. All associated whitespace will be included in the string literal.

```python
print("""
Matt
GTFS
Flex
""")
```

Output

```bash
Matt
GTFS
Flex
```

Some examples of Strings:

```python
# String: Hello, Matt!
print("Hello, Matt!")

# String: Welcome to GTFS Editor!
print("Welcome to GTFS Editor!")
```

## <a id="strings"></a>String Concatenation

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the **+** operator.

Strings will be printed **_exactly_** as they're written.

```python
print("General" + "Transit" + "Feed") # GeneralTransitFeed
```

If we want spaces between our strings, we have to include them ourselves.

```python
# spaces inside another string
print("General" + " Transit " + "Feed") # General Transit Feed

# spaces inside their own strings
print("General" + " " + "Transit" + " " + "Feed") # General Transit Feed
```

## <a id="methods"></a>Methods

Methods are functions that manipulate the piece of data to which they're attached. In Python, many datatypes have methods, including strings.

Find a full list of string methods [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).

### Common string methods:

| method       | description                                               | example                    | result        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| capitalize() | Converts the first letter to uppercase                    | "hello world".capitalize() | "Hello world" |
| lower()      | Converts a string to lowercase                            | "Hello World".lower()      | "hello world" |
| strip()      | Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string | " Hello World ".strip()    | "Hello World" |
| title()      | Converts the first character of each word to uppercase    | "hello world".title()      | "Hello World" |
| upper()      | Converts a string to uppercase                            | "hello world".upper()      | "HELLO WORLD" |

## <a id="escape"></a>Escape Characters

Escape characters allow us to use special characters inside a string. They also allow us to use 'illegal' characters in a string, such as a double quote withing a string surrounded by double quotes.
An escape character is a `\` followed by the character you want to insert.
|code|result|
|---|---|
|`\'`|Single Quote|
|`\"`|Double Quote|
|`\\`|Backslash|
|`\n`|New Line|
|`\t`|Tab|
