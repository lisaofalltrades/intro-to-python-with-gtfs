# Welcome
Welcome to Intro to Python with [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/).

> The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an Open Standard used to distribute relevant information about transit systems to riders. It allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a wide variety of software applications. Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers.

We'll be using this public dataset as an example to learn the fundamentals of Python and real-life application.
